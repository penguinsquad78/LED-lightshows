# LED-lightshows
These are some programs (and wiring diagrams) for Arduino boards and LEDs combined for fantastic light shows! These can be made for dance parties, ambient lighting, or any other use case for an LED light show. You choose the colors! (although the LED manufacturer has a lot of influence in the color choice as well)
