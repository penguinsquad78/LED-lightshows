# LED Lightshows

Woo hoo! With these fantastic projects to make, you'll be making boring LEDs dance in ways never seen before! Add your finished products to dance parties, mood lighting (or even your ceiling fan?), and more!

Each folder is a different project. Each one includes the code ({project_name}.ino), a schematic diagram (schematic.pdf), a wiring diagram that's easier to follow (diagram.png), and a supplies list (supplies.csv). Simply get the stuff needed, follow the diagram to wire it up, open the INO file in Arduino IDE, upload it to your board, and BAM! The LEDs should start dancing!

Feel free to go crazy and replace 3 LEDs with an RGB LED (just make sure to ground it!) or pick your own colors!

The diagrams were made with [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com).

The code was all done by me.

If you watched my video, Light Party Circuits, you're probably looking for [Simple Show].
